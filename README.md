This Program uses inquirer to ask for a github username and a favorite color in the terminal.

To run this file, open index.js and run the program.  If it does not work, you will need to NPM install inquirer, puppeteer and axios.

Input a Github user name and a favorite color when prompted.  Based on those two inputs, the program will output a styled PDF page populated with info from the github profile that you searched for.
